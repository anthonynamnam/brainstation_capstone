    The North American used car market is a boundless and dynamic landscape, 
    characterized by a huge industry of vehicle makes, models, and relentnessly 
    evolving market dynamics. In 2022, the used car market recorded 38.6 millions 
    sales volume in United States ([Source: statista](#https://www.statista.com/statistics/183713/value-of-us-passenger-cas-sales-and-leases-since-1990/)).

    Buyers and sellers often grapple with the challenge of accurately determining 
    the fair market value of a used car, leading to potential disparities in pricing, 
    suboptimal transactions, and general market inefficiencies. The dilemma of accurately 
    pricing a used vehicles remains a persistent enigma for years. According to [canadadrives](#https://www.canadadrives.ca/blog/car-guide/selling-a-used-car-privately), 
    it takes up to 4 weeks to sell a used car. For both sellers and buyers, this dilemma often 
    transforms into uncertainty, frustration, and even missed opportunities.

    My friend, Jason, who lived in Vancouver for 2 years, wanted to get a car recently. 
    He did not have enough budget to get a new car. Therefore, he decided to buy a second-hand vehicle. 
    He went to several dealers for inquiries. However, all dealer agents tried to persuade him to pay at
    a higher price to get a better car. At last, he got his car from craigslist directly from the previous
    owner within his budget and his requirement.

    """
    The problem we try to address in this project remains focus on the need for accurate and transparent pricing 
    in the North American used car market. The wide variety of vehicles, including numerous makes, models, years, 
    mileage, drivetrains, transmission and geographic locations, contributes to the complexity of this problem.

    - Buyers often find it difficult to assess whether a listed car's price is reasonable, leading to price 
    uncertainty and the potential for overpayment.
    - Sellers may often struggle to set competitive (higher) and attractive (lower) listing prices, potentially
    resulting in unsuccessful sales or missed opportunity.
